**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The week starts on Sunday, June 09, 2025, and ends on Saturday, June 15, 2025. The timezone is EST.
    *   Waking hours are from 08:00 to 22:00.

2.  **Blocked Time Insertion:**
    *   First, I inserted all the blocked times (the existing classes and meetings) into the schedule. These serve as hard constraints that the other tasks must be scheduled around.
    *   The SUMMARY of each event is set to the specified title.

3.  **Task Scheduling:**
    *   I processed tasks in the following order based on heuristics and time preferences:
        1.  Exercise (Morning Preference, 1 hour, 2 times)
        2.  Study (Afternoon Preference, 1 hour, 4 times)
        3.  Reading (Evening Preference, 1 hour, 3 times)

4.  **Heuristic Application and Decision Making:**
    *   **Prioritize shorter durations:** All tasks were of the same duration so this was not a discriminating factor.
    *   **Transition Time:** I attempted to leave at least 15 minutes between tasks to allow for transition time. This was not always possible to fit all tasks into the schedule in a balanced manner.
    *   **Spread tasks evenly:** I scheduled tasks across different days to avoid clustering them on a single day. Given the hard constraints, this was sometimes difficult.
    *   **Time Preferences:** I attempted to schedule tasks during their preferred times (Morning for Exercise, Afternoon for Study, Evening for Reading).  When direct placement wasn't possible due to conflicts or availability, I tried to schedule them as close to their preference as possible without violating other constraints or heuristics.

5.  **Specific Scheduling Decisions:**
    *   **Exercise:** Scheduled for Monday and Friday mornings at 08:00 to accommodate the morning preference. I prioritized Exercise because getting it done early is beneficial. The slot was open on both days at 08:00.
    *   **Study:** Scheduled across Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoons, avoiding Wednesday and Saturday due to the pre-existing events and the desire to spread events out. Times were selected based on gaps in the schedule after accounting for the blocked times.
    *   **Reading:** Scheduled for Sunday, Monday, and Saturday evenings, adhering to the preference for the evening. Monday was selected since reading is not physically intensive and can occur after exercise. Similarly, Saturday was chosen to accommodate for being on the weekend. A slot was selected on Sunday to begin the week appropriately. Each task had its slot chosen based on the earliest availability.

6.  **Conflict Resolution:**
    *   When a task's preferred time was blocked, I looked for the next available slot that was closest to the preferred time. I avoided scheduling tasks outside of waking hours (08:00-22:00). If a task couldn't fit within waking hours, I shifted it to the next available day.

7.  **Limitations and Challenges:**
    *   The inflexible pre-existing events made distributing the tasks evenly more challenging. They severely reduced flexibility, especially on Wednesday. Ideally, the blocked times would be more flexible.
    *   The equal duration of each task made prioritization less impactful.

8.  **Potential Improvements:**
    *   A more sophisticated algorithm could be used to optimize the schedule based on user-defined priorities for each heuristic (e.g.,
