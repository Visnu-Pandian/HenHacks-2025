**Chain of Thought: Scheduling Decisions**

1. **Interpretation of Heuristics:**

   *   *Prioritize tasks with shorter durations:*  Tasks were processed roughly in ascending order of duration to schedule the quickest tasks first.  This allows for more flexibility later in the scheduling process.
   *   *Leave "transition time" between tasks:*  A 15-minute buffer was added between scheduled tasks whenever possible. This transition time aims to prevent back-to-back scheduling, improving user experience.
   *   *Spread tasks out among the week evenly:* The scheduler attempted to distribute tasks throughout the week to avoid overloading any single day. This was achieved by checking daily availability and distributing the tasks across available slots in the week.
   *   *Schedule tasks during business hours (9 AM to 5 PM):* Although not specified, tasks were scheduled between 9 AM and 5 PM local time wherever possible to align with assumed business hours. This was not strictly enforced but served as a guideline.

2. **Order of Task Processing:**

The tasks were initially sorted by duration (Task 4, Task 1, Task 2, Task 3), then scheduled based on availability. Task 4 (1 hour) was considered first, followed by Task 1 (2 hours), Task 2 (3 hours) and Task 3 (4 hours).

3. **Specific Decisions and Task Placement:**

   *   **Sunday, June 09, 2025:** Task 4 was placed here.  A check for conflicts and transition time ensured there was no overlap with other scheduled tasks.
   *   **Monday, June 10, 2025:** Task 1 was scheduled here.  The scheduler ensured the placement adhered to transition time and business hour considerations.
   *   **Tuesday, June 11, 2025:** Task 2 was placed on this day, respecting transition time and business hour guidelines.
   *   **Wednesday, June 12, 2025:** Task 3 was placed on this day, again considering transition time and assumed business hours.
   *   **Thursday, June 13, 2025:** Another Task 4 was placed here, making sure it fits in with transition time.
   *   **Friday, June 14, 2025:** Another Task 1 was placed here, making sure it fits in with transition time.
   *   **Saturday, June 15, 2025:** Another Task 2 was placed here, making sure it fits in with transition time.
   *   Tasks were placed at different hours of the day to evenly spread out work load.
4. **Limitations and Challenges:**

   *   The prompt did not specify a precise waking schedule for each day, requiring the algorithm to assume standard business hours. This could lead to inefficiencies if the user has different working hours.
   *   The lack of specific constraints (e.g., preferred days for certain tasks) made optimal scheduling more challenging. The scheduler distributed tasks as evenly as possible but could not tailor placements to the user's particular preferences.

5. **Potential Improvements:**

   *   Allow the user to specify their preferred working hours for each day of the week.
   *   Implement task prioritization based on user-defined importance levels.
   *   Incorporate dependencies between tasks to ensure that tasks are scheduled in the correct order.
   *   Provide visual feedback to the user, allowing them to adjust the generated schedule and provide input on desired modifications.
