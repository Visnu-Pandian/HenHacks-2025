**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Initialization:** The week starts on Sunday, June 9, 2025, and ends on Saturday, June 15, 2025, all in the EST time zone.  There are nine tasks to schedule: Task 1 (2 hours), Task 2 (3 hours), Task 3 (4 hours), Task 4 (1 hour), Task 5 (2 hours), Task 6 (3 hours), Task 7 (4 hours), Task 8 (1 hour), and Task 9 (2 hours). There are no explicitly blocked times or defined waking hours. I will assume waking hours are from 8 AM to 8 PM. A 15-minute transition time between tasks is ideal.

2.  **Heuristic Application:**
    *   *Prioritize tasks with shorter durations:* This heuristic aims to minimize the fragmentation of the schedule and fit smaller tasks around larger ones. It also improves perceived progress early on.
    *   *Transition Time:*  Aim for 15 minutes between tasks to simulate travel, preparation, or a brief break. If necessary, reduce this to 5 minutes if tasks are tight and the goal is simply to avoid back-to-back scheduling.

3.  **Task Processing Order:** Tasks are initially sorted by duration in ascending order. So it is Task 4, Task 8, Task 1, Task 5, Task 9, Task 2, Task 6, Task 3, Task 7.

4.  **Scheduling Decisions:**
    *   **Sunday, June 09, 2025:**
        *   8:00 AM - 9:00 AM: Task 4 (1 hour). First task of the week, placed at the start of the day.
        *   9:15 AM - 10:15 AM: Task 8 (1 hour). Second shortest task, placed after Task 4, with a 15-minute transition.
        *   10:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Task 1 (2 hours). Placed after Task 8 with a 15-minute transition.
        *   12:30 PM - 1:30 PM: Lunch Break (1 Hour)
        *   1:30 PM - 3:30 PM: Task 5 (2 hours). Placed after lunch break.
        *   3:45 PM - 5:45 PM: Task 9 (2 hours).
    *   **Monday, June 10, 2025:**
        *   8:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Task 2 (3 hours). Started the day with a 3-hour task.
        *   11:15 AM - 2:15 PM: Task 6 (3 hours). Placement with a 15 minutes transition.
        *   2:15 PM - 3:15 PM: Lunch Break (1 Hour)
        *   3:15 PM - 7:15 PM: Task 3 (4 Hours).
    *   **Tuesday, June 11, 2025:**
         *   8:00 AM - 12:00 PM: Task 7 (4 hours).

5.  **Limitations and Challenges:**
    *   The lack of defined waking hours introduced an assumption. Adjusting this would require modifications.
    *   The lack of blocked times means tasks are scheduled freely. Real-world schedules would likely have meetings, appointments, or personal commitments to block out.

6.  **Potential Improvements:**
    *   Incorporating a more sophisticated algorithm to handle task dependencies would be an improvement.
    *   Adding preferences for task placement (e.g.,
