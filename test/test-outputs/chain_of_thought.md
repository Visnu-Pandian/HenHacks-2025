# Chain of Thought:

1.  **Initialization and Time Zone:** The week starts on Sunday, March 2, 2025, and ends on Saturday, March 8, 2025, all times in EST.
2.  **Blocked Time:** Prioritize the blocked time as indicated in the prompt.
3.  **Task Prioritization:** Tasks are processed based on the user's defined start time. Tasks without a user defined start time are scheduled after the other tasks are scheduled.
4.  **Heuristic Application:**
    *   **Duration:** Prioritize shorter tasks to allow for easier scheduling and minimize potential conflicts. Tasks with short duration are scheduled first.
    *   **Transition Time:** Add 15-minute buffer between tasks to prevent back-to-back events, improving user experience.
    *   **Even Distribution:** Attempt to distribute tasks evenly throughout the week to avoid overloading specific days.
    *   **Business Hours:** Prioritize scheduling potentially work related tasks during business hours (9AM-5PM).

5.  **Scheduling Process:**
    *   First, schedule all the tasks with user-defined start times:
        *   **Church:** Scheduled for March 2, 2025, at 16:00 for 1 hour.
        *   **Dinner with Family:** Scheduled for March 2, 2025, at 23:00 for 2 hours, bleeding into the next day.
        *   **Drive brother to school:** Scheduled for March 3, 2025, at 13:00 for 1 hour.
        *   **CyberWVU meeting:** Scheduled for March 3, 2025, at 22:00 for 1 hour.
        *   **Lunch with Bob:** Scheduled for March 4, 2025, at 17:00 for 1.5 hours.
        *   **Book Club:** Scheduled for March 5, 2025, at 17:00 for 1 hour.
        *   **Volunteering at Animal Shelter:** Scheduled for March 5, 2025, at 20:00 for 1 hour.
        *   **Pickleball with Danny:** Scheduled for March 6, 2025, at 17:45 for 2 hours.
        *   **Dentist Appointment:** Scheduled for March 7, 2025, at 15:00 for 1 hour.
        *   **Bob's Birthday Party:** Scheduled for March 7, 2025, at 20:00 for 3 hours.
    *   Then, schedule tasks without user-defined start times:
        *   **Skiing:** Schedule for March 3, 2025, at 08:00 for 1.5 hours (90 minutes).
        *   **Skiing:** Schedule for March 4, 2025, at 08:00 for 1.5 hours (90 minutes).

6.  **Limitations and Challenges:**
    *   The prompt does not specify how to handle conflicting tasks. The current implementation prioritizes tasks with user-defined start times and then schedules the others around them. This could lead to tasks without start times being scheduled at less ideal times, such as at the very beginning or end of the day.
    *   The prompt does not specify any priorities for tasks without user-defined start times. Currently these tasks are scheduled based on the order in which they appear in the prompt.

7.  **Potential Improvements:**
    *   Incorporate user-defined priorities to resolve scheduling conflicts and ensure that more important tasks are scheduled at preferred times.
    *   Consider adding a "weight" to each heuristic to allow the user to customize the scheduling algorithm based on their preferences. For example, a user could prioritize even distribution over transition time.
    *   Implement a more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanism that takes into account the task's description and importance.
    *   Add a preference for working hours to tasks without a user-defined start time to schedule business tasks during business hours.
