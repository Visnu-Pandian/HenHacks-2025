**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Initialization and Blocked Times:** I started by setting the week's start date to Sunday, June 09, 2025, and ensuring all times are in EST. I then added the blocked times (previously imported tasks) to the schedule to ensure no new tasks are scheduled during these periods. This was done first to establish unchangeable constraints.

2. **Heuristic Application:**
   *   **Prioritize shorter durations:** Tasks were generally scheduled in ascending order of duration where possible. This meant 'Eat' (30 mins) was prioritized over 'Work Out' (60 mins) and 'Study' (120 mins).
   *   **Transition Time:** A 15-minute transition time was attempted between tasks to prevent a crammed schedule, but that was not always possible, especially for the days with the blocked times.
   *   **Spread out tasks:** Tasks were distributed as evenly as possible across the week to avoid overloading any single day. I tried to find available slots on different days for each occurrence of a task.
   *   **Business Hours:** The heuristic about business hours was mainly applied to the 'Work Out' tasks to encourage scheduling it during those times, but this was only weakly followed.

3. **Task Scheduling Order:** The tasks were processed in the following order based on duration and quantity, while respecting the constraints imposed by the blocked times.

    *   Eat (shortest duration, 5 times)
    *   Break (60 min, 3 times)
    *   Work Out (60 min, 3 times)
    *   Study (120 min, 2 times)

4. **Specific Scheduling Decisions:**

    *   **Eat:** Given the short duration and evening preference, I scattered these throughout the week, mostly in the late evenings. The first one was scheduled for June 9, 2025 at 21:00. There were also other times, at 21:00 each day to distribute the task quantity, leaving 15 minute break where possible.
    *   **Break:** With a duration of 60 minutes and a morning preference, these were scheduled on June 10, June 12, and June 14 in the mornings. These tasks are not scheduled on the same days as the blocked task.
    *   **Work Out:** These were placed mostly in the early afternoons to accommodate the time preference, on June 11, June 13, and June 15. These are placed in the early afternoon to satisfy the heuristic of business hours.
    *   **Study:** Due to the long duration and evening preference, these were scheduled on June 10, and June 12 at 19:15.

5. **Conflict Resolution:** The main challenge was fitting tasks around the blocked times while trying to evenly distribute the tasks across the week. Sometimes, the transition time had to be reduced or eliminated due to time constraints.

6. **Limitations and Challenges:**
    *   The rigid 'waking hours' constraint sometimes forced tasks to be moved to subsequent days, potentially disrupting the even distribution.
    *   The combination of blocked times and task durations created some scheduling limitations, especially towards the middle of the week.
    *   Balancing time preferences with the desire to avoid back-to-back scheduling proved difficult at times.

7. **Potential Improvements:**
    *   The heuristics could be weighted or prioritized dynamically based on task properties or user preferences.
    *   A more sophisticated algorithm could be used to optimize task placement based on a combination of factors, such as minimizing task shifting or maximizing transition time.
    *   Allowing tasks to split across multiple days could provide more flexibility in fitting them into the schedule.
