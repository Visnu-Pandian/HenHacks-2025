**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Initialization and Heuristic Prioritization:**
    *   The week starts on Sunday, June 09, 2025, and ends on Saturday, June 15, 2025, all times in EST.
    *   Waking hours are 08:00 to 22:00.
    *   No blocked times are specified, simplifying the scheduling process.
    *   Heuristic priorities:
        1.  Prioritize shorter duration tasks.
        2.  Leave transition time between tasks (15 minutes).
        3.  Spread tasks evenly throughout the week.
        4.  Schedule business-hour-sensitive tasks during 9AM-5PM.

2.  **Task Ordering:**
    *   Tasks were sorted by duration (shortest to longest): Task 4 (1 hour), Task 1 (2 hours), Task 2 (3 hours), Task 3 (4 hours).
    *   This order aims to fit shorter tasks first, increasing flexibility for longer tasks.

3.  **Scheduling Process:**

    *   **Task 4 (1 hour, 5 times, Afternoon Preference):**
        *   Scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday afternoons, starting around 14:00 to 15:00, with 15-minute buffers.  Prioritized this task due to short duration and high frequency.

    *   **Task 1 (2 hours, 2 times, Afternoon Preference):**
        *   Scheduled for Sunday and Saturday afternoons, around 14:00 and 15:00. Attempted to maintain the afternoon preference while avoiding conflicts.

    *   **Task 2 (3 hours, 3 times, Evening Preference):**
        *   Scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings, starting around 18:00. This fulfills the evening preference while working around other tasks.

    *   **Task 3 (4 hours, 4 times, Morning Preference):**
        *   Scheduled for Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday mornings, starting around 09:00. Aimed for the morning preference, scheduling before other tasks.

4.  **Conflict Resolution and Transition Times:**
    *   Transition times (15 minutes) were added between tasks to minimize back-to-back scheduling.
    *   The initial placement was done with time preferences considered and then adjustments were made to avoid overlaps while considering all time constraints.

5.  **Limitations and Challenges:**
    *   The primary challenge was balancing the time preferences of each task with even distribution throughout the week and the avoidance of conflicts.  This meant that some tasks might not be at their *ideal* time but a time as close as possible to that.
    *   No blocked times made scheduling simpler, but real-world scenarios would require handling those constraints.

6.  **Potential Improvements:**
    *   A more sophisticated algorithm could dynamically adjust transition times based on task context.
    *   Consider incorporating a user-defined "energy level" for different times of the day to further optimize task placement.
    *   Add the ability to reschedule or dynamically adjust task assignments based on user feedback/behavior.
    *   Implementation of a machine learning component that learns from scheduling history and user feedback to improve future schedules.
