**Chain of Thought: Weekly Schedule Generation**

**1. Initialization & Input Processing:**

*   The week is defined as Sunday, June 09, 2025, to Saturday, June 15, 2025, in the EST timezone.
*   Waking hours are set to 'None specified', meaning all 24 hours are available for scheduling, although morning, afternoon and evening preferences need to be met.
*   Tasks are read in order of their provided duration. Shorted duration tasks are scheduled first, as this makes it easier to place them into the schedule. Task 4 (1 hour) is first, then Task 1 (2 hours), then Task 2 (3 hours) and Task 3 (4 hours) last.
*   No blocked times are specified.

**2. Heuristic Application:**

*   **Prioritize shorter durations:** Shorter tasks (Task 4 and Task 1) are scheduled before longer tasks (Task 2 and Task 3). This makes it easier to fit the shorter tasks around the longer ones and minimizes potential conflicts.
*   **Transition Time:**  A 15-minute buffer is attempted between tasks where possible.  This is more easily achieved when there are fewer back-to-back tasks, or when there is an imposed business hour to work around.
*   **Spread Tasks Evenly:** The algorithm attempts to distribute tasks evenly across the week. This prevents overloading specific days.
*   **Time Preferences:** Attempt to schedule tasks during their preferred time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).  If this causes a conflict, the task is moved to the next available slot while still adhering to the 'spread evenly' and 'transition time' heuristics.

**3. Scheduling Process:**

*   **Task 4 (1 hour, 5 times, Afternoon preference):** Scheduled for the afternoon. Evenly distributed across Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. Start times were chosen to leave sufficient gaps between tasks.
*   **Task 1 (2 hours, 2 times, Afternoon preference):** Scheduled for the afternoon. Occurring on Tuesday and Friday.
*   **Task 2 (3 hours, 3 times, Evening preference):** Scheduled for the evening, to meet the preferences. Occurring on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.
*   **Task 3 (4 hours, 4 times, Morning preference):** Scheduled for the morning, to meet the preferences. Occurring on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

**4. Conflict Resolution:**

*   No explicit blocked times were provided, so no conflicts directly arose from that input.
*   Conflicts arise mostly from meeting preferences and trying to spread events evenly. Shifting to alternative days or times on same day was used to resolve.

**5. Limitations and Challenges:**

*   The absence of defined waking hours makes it difficult to optimize based on typical business hours. However, preference was given to morning, afternoon or evening times, as requested.
*   The even distribution heuristic can sometimes conflict with time preferences.  A weighting system to prioritize preferences could be implemented.
*   The code doesn't dynamically adjust transition time based on task length. Longer tasks might benefit from slightly longer transition times.

**6. Potential Improvements:**

*   Add a priority level to each task to allow for prioritizing more important tasks. This would affect the order in which tasks are scheduled.
*   Implement a dynamic transition time adjustment based on task length or type.
*   Provide an explicit 'business hours' constraint to refine scheduling within those hours.
*   Implement a machine learning component to learn user preferences over time and automatically adjust scheduling heuristics.
*   Check that task length does not go over preferences (e.g. a 4 hour task in the afternoon could push some tasks over to evening)
