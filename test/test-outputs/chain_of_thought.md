**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Initialization:** The week starts on Sunday, June 09, 2025, and ends on Saturday, June 15, 2025, in the EST timezone. There were no specific waking hours defined, so I assumed all 24 hours are available. There were no blocked times specified.

2.  **Task Prioritization and Ordering:** The tasks were initially ordered based on duration, prioritizing shorter tasks (Task 4, Task 1, Task 2, Task 3) according to the 'Prioritize tasks with shorter durations' heuristic. This aimed to fit smaller tasks first, leaving more flexibility for longer ones. However, during the scheduling process, this order was somewhat adjusted based on time preferences.

3.  **Time Preference Consideration:** Each task had a time preference (Morning, Afternoon, Evening). I attempted to schedule tasks within these preferred times as much as possible.

4.  **Scheduling Loop:** The scheduling process iterated through the days of the week and the prioritized task list. For each task, I attempted to find a suitable time slot within the preferred time of day, considering the task's duration and the need for transition time.

    *   **Transition Time:** I aimed for 15-minute transition times between tasks. This was implemented by adding 15 minutes to the end time of each task before scheduling the next one. However, due to the relatively high task volume, this was not always possible.

    *   **Even Distribution:** The goal was to distribute tasks evenly across the week. I attempted to avoid scheduling multiple long tasks on the same day. If a day was already heavily loaded, I would skip to the next day.

    *   **Business Hours:** I attempted to schedule tasks that seemed like they may be more appropriate during business hours (9 AM to 5 PM) within those hours. However, there were no specific instructions to prioritize this, and no tasks stood out as needing to be completed during this time. This heuristic was therefore not a major factor.

5.  **Specific Scheduling Decisions:**

    *   Task 4 (1 hour, Afternoon, 5 times) was scheduled first due to its short duration. It was placed in various afternoons throughout the week.
    *   Task 1 (2 hours, Afternoon, 2 times) was then placed on two other afternoons.
    *   Task 2 (3 hours, Evening, 3 times) was placed during the evenings.
    *   Task 3 (4 hours, Morning, 4 times) was placed during the mornings of the remaining days.

6.  **Conflict Resolution:** There were no blocked times, so conflicts arose only from tasks overlapping. Conflicts were avoided by checking if a time slot was available before scheduling a task. If a conflict occurred, the task was moved to the next available time slot that respected the specified time preference, or to the next day.

7.  **Limitations and Challenges:**

    *   The lack of defined waking hours made it harder to allocate tasks.
    *   The heuristic to prioritize shorter tasks sometimes conflicted with the 'spread tasks evenly' heuristic.

8.  **Potential Improvements:**

    *   Implement a more sophisticated conflict resolution strategy that considers task priorities.
    *   Allow tasks to be split across multiple days if necessary.
    *   Develop a more adaptive task ordering algorithm that takes time preferences into account.
    *   Gathering more information on waking hours would drastically improve the algorithm.
    *   Priorities between tasks were not specified. Allowing to prioritize tasks would greatly optimize the schedule.
