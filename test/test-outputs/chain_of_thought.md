**Chain of Thought:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - I began by establishing the week's boundaries, starting from Sunday, June 9, 2025, and ending on Saturday, June 15, 2025.  All times are in EST. I created an empty calendar object to be filled. Also, important is the definition of working hours, which are 08:00 to 22:00.

2. **Task Prioritization and Ordering:**
   - The heuristic "Prioritize tasks with shorter durations" was applied. Therefore, the tasks were initially ordered as follows: Task 1 (1 hour), Task 2 (2 hours), Task 3 (3 hours), and Task 4 (4 hours).

3. **Blocked Time Integration:**
   - The blocked time slot (Morning Meeting on June 10, 2025, from 08:00 to 09:00) was immediately added to the calendar to ensure it wouldn't be overwritten by task scheduling.

4. **Task Scheduling:**
   - I iterated through the tasks in the prioritized order, attempting to schedule them within the available time slots, considering the working hours (08:00-22:00) each day.
   - **Task 1 (1 hour):**  Scheduled for June 9, 2025 at 09:00. A 15-minute transition time was added after the task.
   - **Task 2 (2 hours):** Scheduled for June 9, 2025 at 11:00. A 15-minute transition time was added after the task.
   - **Task 3 (3 hours):** Scheduled for June 9, 2025 at 14:00. A 15-minute transition time was added after the task.
   - **Task 4 (4 hours):** Scheduled for June 9, 2025 at 18:00. No transition time was added since it is the last task of the day.

5. **Break and Meal Considerations:**
   - I did not have any specific instructions for meal times, and the work day was not too full.  I chose to leave lunch implicit for the user.

6. **Conflict Resolution:**
   - No explicit conflicts arose due to the relatively open schedule after incorporating the blocked time. However, in a real-world scenario with many more tasks, conflict resolution would become a more significant aspect.

7. **Limitations:**
   - The heuristic "Prioritize tasks with shorter durations" is relatively simplistic. In a real-world setting, tasks may have deadlines or dependencies that necessitate a different approach.
   - The lack of defined breaks and meal times results in a potentially unrealistic schedule for a working professional, as the user may want to make more specific scheduling decisions.
   - Weekends were not taken into account. The calendar just schedules activities for consecutive days. 

8. **Potential Improvements:**
   - Implement a more sophisticated task prioritization system that considers deadlines, dependencies, and importance levels.
   - Incorporate explicit break and meal times based on user preferences.
   - Allow for more flexible scheduling based on user availability and preferences, including weekend availability and preferred working hours.
   - Add error handling and validation to ensure the .ics file is generated correctly and that the input data is valid.
   - Add capability to generate repeating events for tasks, blocked times, and other calendar items.
