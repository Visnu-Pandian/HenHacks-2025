Generate an iCalendar (.ics) file representing a weekly schedule based on the following information:

I want this week to start from Sunday, June 09, 2025, and end on Saturday, June 15, 2025.
The time zone for all provided dates and times is EST.

Normal waking hours are from 09:00 to 23:00 in the defined timezone. All tasks should be allotted within these waking hours. If a task goes beyond the waking hours, the task should be allotted to the next day.

**Blocked Times:**
The following tasks were from previously imported tasks. The SUMMARY for each event should be the title corresponding to the event (which is indicated with each event), so place the following tasks into the file first:
* Start: 17:00
	  End: 19:00
No new tasks after these ones can be allotted during these times.

**Tasks:**
* Title: Work Out
	  Description: Go to the gym
	  Duration: 60 minutes
	 Quantity: 3
	 Time Preference: afternoon
* Title: Study
	  Description: Study for math
	  Duration: 120 minutes
	 Quantity: 2
	 Time Preference: evening
* Title: Eat 
	  Description: Eat Food
	  Duration: 30 minutes
	 Quantity: 5
	 Time Preference: evening
* Title: Break
	  Description: Take a walk
	  Duration: 60 minutes
	 Quantity: 3
	 Time Preference: morning

Do not just stack all the tasks at the start of the day. Scatter them throughout the available time slots.

**Heuristics:** 
Use the heuristics as guidelines for optimizing the schedule for the user's benefit:

* Prioritize tasks with shorter durations.
* Leave "transition time" between tasks to avoid back-to-back scheduling. Ideally, they should be about 15 minutes, but use your best judgment.
* Attempt to spread the tasks out among the week as evenly as possible.
* If it seems that a task needs to be completed during business hours, schedule it during business hours (9AM to 5PM).

**Output Requirements:**

1.  Generate a valid .ics file containing the scheduled tasks and blocked times.
2.  After generating the .ics file, provide a detailed "chain of thought" in markdown format (using bold and stuff when necessary) explaining your reasoning behind the scheduling decisions. This explanation should include:
* How you interpreted and applied each of the provided heuristics.
* The order in which you processed the tasks.
* Specific decisions made during the scheduling process, such as task placement and conflict resolution.
* Any limitations or challenges encountered during the process.
* Potential improvements to the schedule or heuristics.

Keep this information as clear as possible. The goal is to clearly state your thought process so that we can use it to re-engineer the prompt to better serve our use case.

Please ensure the .ics file is properly formatted and includes all necessary iCalendar properties (e.g., UID, DTSTAMP, VERSION, PRODID).
