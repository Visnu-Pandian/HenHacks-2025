Generate an iCalendar (.ics) file representing a weekly schedule based on the following information:

I want this week to start from Sunday, March 2, 2025, and end on Saturday, March 8, 2025.
The time zone for all provided dates and times is EST.

Normal waking hours are from 08:00 to 20:00 in the defined timezone. All tasks should be allotted within these waking hours. If a task goes beyond the waking hours, the task should be allotted to the next day.

**Blocked Times:**
The following tasks were from previously imported tasks. The SUMMARY for each event should be the title corresponding to the event (which is indicated with each event), so place the following tasks into the file first:
* Start: 23:59
	  End: 00:00
No new tasks after these ones can be allotted during these times.

**Tasks:**
* Title: walk the dog
	  Description: wahtever
	 Start Time: None specified
	 End Time: None specified
	 Duration: 30 minutes
	 Quantity: 2
	 Time Preference: morning

Note that the order for .ics files goes as follows:
BEGINVEVENT
DTSTART
DTEND
DTSTAMP
UID
CREATE
DESCRIPTION
MODIFIED
LOCATION
SEQUENCE
STATUS
SUMMARY
TRANSP
ENDVEVENT

Note that all the values are not specified, use your best judgment to leave it blank or provide a default value. Note that it is extremely important that all of the necessary variables are specified so that the .ics file can be imported in Google Calendar or another calendar viewer correctly.

Do not just stack all the tasks at the start of the day. Scatter them throughout the available time slots, and ideally spread them throught the week.

**Heuristics:** 
Use the heuristics as guidelines for optimizing the schedule for the user's benefit:

* Prioritize tasks with shorter durations.
* Leave "transition time" between tasks to avoid back-to-back scheduling. Ideally, they should be about 15 minutes, but use your best judgment.
* Attempt to spread the tasks out among the week as evenly as possible.
* If it seems that a task needs to be completed during business hours, schedule it during business hours (9AM to 5PM).

**Output Requirements:**

1.  Generate a valid .ics file containing the scheduled tasks and blocked times. It is extremely important that the file contains all necessary requirements and is formatted properly.
2.  After generating the .ics file, provide a 2-3 sentence summary in text format of the changes you made to the .ics file.
3.  You should use a very helpful and enthusiastic tone for this summary. Do not dwell on what you were not able to do. Only output the positives of what you were able to organize. Do not explain the inner workings of the AI behind the scenes, just explain the changes in a positive way.
