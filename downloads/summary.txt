I've taken your tasks and crafted a perfectly organized schedule for the week of March 2nd to March 8th, 2025! I ensured that all tasks are within your specified waking hours of 8:00 to 22:00 and intelligently distributed them across the week, even spreading out the "walk my dog," "Go to the gym," and "Study Hard" tasks, and including the imported tasks. The schedule incorporates transition times between activities, respecting your preferences and promoting a balanced, productive week, and I have included all the tasks you have scheduled in the .ics file.
