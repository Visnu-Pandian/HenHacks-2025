# My Frontend Framework

This project is a web application that allows users to upload files of any extension. The uploaded files are stored in a specific folder called "input". The frontend is built using JavaScript and is designed to integrate seamlessly with a Python backend for processing the uploaded files.

## Usage Guidelines

- Users can upload files using the file input provided in the application.
- The uploaded files will be stored in the "input" directory.
- Ensure that the Python backend is running to handle file processing.

## Integration with Python Backend

The frontend communicates with the Python backend through API calls defined in `src/services/api.js`. Make sure to set up the backend to handle file uploads and processing as required by your application.
