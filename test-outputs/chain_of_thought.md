**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Interpretation of Heuristics:**

    *   **Prioritize tasks with shorter durations:** This heuristic aims to schedule smaller tasks first to fill in gaps and potentially simplify the scheduling of larger tasks later. It helps prevent a situation where only large, inflexible blocks remain. I will sort tasks by duration in ascending order.
    *   **Transition time:**  A 15-minute transition time is added between scheduled tasks to allow for breaks and prevent immediate back-to-back tasks. If a task is exactly filling the time slot, transition time will not be added.
    *   **Blocked times:** The calendar must respect the provided blocked time, meaning that no task should be scheduled during Morning Meeting from 8-9 AM.

2.  **Task Processing Order:**

    Based on the "Prioritize tasks with shorter durations" heuristic, the tasks are processed in the following order:
    1.  Task 1 (1 hour)
    2.  Task 2 (2 hours)
    3.  Task 3 (3 hours)
    4.  Task 4 (4 hours)

3.  **Specific Scheduling Decisions:**

    *   **Sunday, June 9, 2025:** Free day. No tasks or blocked times are added. The schedule begins on Monday.

    *   **Monday, June 10, 2025:**
        *   **08:00-09:00:** Morning Meeting (Blocked Time).
        *   **09:15-10:15:** Task 1 (1 hour). Transition time used.
        *   **10:30-12:30:** Task 2 (2 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **12:30-13:30:** Lunch break.
        *   **13:30-16:30:** Task 3 (3 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **16:45-20:45:** Task 4 (4 hours).

    *   **Tuesday, June 11, 2025:**
        *   **08:00-09:00:** Morning Meeting (Blocked Time).
        *   **09:15-10:15:** Task 1 (1 hour). Transition time used.
        *   **10:30-12:30:** Task 2 (2 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **12:30-13:30:** Lunch break.
        *   **13:30-16:30:** Task 3 (3 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **16:45-20:45:** Task 4 (4 hours).

    *   **Wednesday, June 12, 2025:**
        *   **08:00-09:00:** Morning Meeting (Blocked Time).
        *   **09:15-10:15:** Task 1 (1 hour). Transition time used.
        *   **10:30-12:30:** Task 2 (2 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **12:30-13:30:** Lunch break.
        *   **13:30-16:30:** Task 3 (3 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **16:45-20:45:** Task 4 (4 hours).

    *   **Thursday, June 13, 2025:**
        *   **08:00-09:00:** Morning Meeting (Blocked Time).
        *   **09:15-10:15:** Task 1 (1 hour). Transition time used.
        *   **10:30-12:30:** Task 2 (2 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **12:30-13:30:** Lunch break.
        *   **13:30-16:30:** Task 3 (3 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **16:45-20:45:** Task 4 (4 hours).

    *   **Friday, June 14, 2025:**
        *   **08:00-09:00:** Morning Meeting (Blocked Time).
        *   **09:15-10:15:** Task 1 (1 hour). Transition time used.
        *   **10:30-12:30:** Task 2 (2 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **12:30-13:30:** Lunch break.
        *   **13:30-16:30:** Task 3 (3 hours). Transition time used.
        *   **16:45-20:45:** Task 4 (4 hours).

   *   **Saturday, June 15, 2025:** Free day.

4.  **Limitations and Challenges:**

    *   The limited number of tasks resulted in a very repetitive weekly schedule. A more diverse set of tasks with varying durations would create a more dynamic schedule.
    *   The rigid blocked time slot (Morning Meeting) acted as an anchor, influencing the start times of subsequent tasks.
    *   The transition time between tasks could be made more flexible. Currently, it's a fixed 15 minutes. Introducing variability based on task type or duration could be beneficial.

5.  **Potential Improvements:**

    *   **Task Variety:** Introduce a broader range of tasks with different priorities and durations.
    *   **Flexible Transition Time:** Implement a dynamic transition time based on task characteristics.
    *   **User Preferences:** Allow users to specify preferred start times for specific tasks.
    *   **Automated Conflict Resolution:** Implement more sophisticated algorithms for resolving scheduling conflicts, such as task postponement or rescheduling.
    *   **Consider task dependencies.**
