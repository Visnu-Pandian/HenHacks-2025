**Output Requirements:**

1.  Generate a valid .ics file containing the scheduled tasks and blocked times.
2.  After generating the .ics file, provide a detailed "chain of thought" in markdown format (using bold and stuff when necessary) explaining your reasoning behind the scheduling decisions. This explanation should include:
* How you interpreted and applied each of the provided heuristics.
* The order in which you processed the tasks.
* Specific decisions made during the scheduling process, such as task placement and conflict resolution.
* Any limitations or challenges encountered during the process.
* Potential improvements to the schedule or heuristics.

Keep this information as clear as possible. The goal is to clearly state your thought process so that we can use it to re-engineer the prompt to better serve our use case.

Please ensure the .ics file is properly formatted and includes all necessary iCalendar properties (e.g., UID, DTSTAMP, VERSION, PRODID).
