**Output Requirements:**

1.  Generate a valid .ics file containing the scheduled tasks and blocked times. It is extremely important that the file contains all necessary requirements and is formatted properly.
2.  After generating the .ics file, provide a 2-3 sentence summary in text format of the changes you made to the .ics file.
3.  You should use a very helpful and enthusiastic tone for this summary. Do not dwell on what you were not able to do. Only output the positives of what you were able to organize. Do not explain the inner workings of the AI behind the scenes, just explain the changes in a positive way.
