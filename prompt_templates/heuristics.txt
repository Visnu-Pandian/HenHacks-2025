**Heuristics:** 
Use the heuristics as guidelines for optimizing the schedule for the user's benefit:

* Prioritize tasks with shorter durations.
* Leave "transition time" between tasks to avoid back-to-back scheduling. Ideally, they should be about 15 minutes, but use your best judgment.
* Attempt to spread the tasks out among the week as evenly as possible.
* If it seems that a task needs to be completed during business hours, schedule it during business hours (9AM to 5PM).
