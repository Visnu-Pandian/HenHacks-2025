**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   The week starts on Sunday, June 09, 2025, and ends on Saturday, June 15, 2025 (EST). 
    *   Normal working hours are from 08:00 to 22:00 (EST).
    *   Tasks are:
        *   Task 1: 1 hour
        *   Task 2: 2 hours
        *   Task 3: 3 hours
        *   Task 4: 4 hours
    *   Blocked Time:
        *   2025-06-10T08:00:00Z to 2025-06-10T09:00:00Z (Morning Meeting)
    *   Heuristic: Prioritize shorter duration tasks.
    *   Aim for a 15-minute transition time between tasks.

2.  **Task Prioritization:**
    *   Based on the heuristic to prioritize shorter tasks, the order of scheduling is Task 1 (1 hour), Task 2 (2 hours), Task 3 (3 hours), and Task 4 (4 hours).

3.  **Scheduling Process:**
    *   **Sunday, June 09, 2025:**
        *   Schedule Task 1 (1 hour) at 08:00. End at 09:00.
        *   Schedule Task 2 (2 hours) at 09:15 (15-minute transition). End at 11:15.
        *   Schedule Task 3 (3 hours) at 11:30 (15-minute transition). End at 14:30.
        *   Schedule Task 4 (4 hours) at 14:45 (15-minute transition). End at 18:45.
    *   **Monday, June 10, 2025:**
        *   Blocked from 08:00 to 09:00 (Morning Meeting). Schedule Task 1 from 09:15 to 10:15. 
        *   Schedule Task 2 (2 hours) at 10:30. End at 12:30. 
        *   Schedule Task 3 (3 hours) at 12:45. End at 15:45. 
        *   Schedule Task 4 (4 hours) at 16:00. End at 20:00. 
    *   **Tuesday, June 11, 2025:**
        *   Schedule Task 1 from 08:00 to 09:00.
        *   Schedule Task 2 from 09:15 to 11:15
        *   Schedule Task 3 from 11:30 to 14:30
        *   Schedule Task 4 from 14:45 to 18:45
    *   **Wednesday, June 12, 2025:**
        *   Schedule Task 1 from 08:00 to 09:00.
        *   Schedule Task 2 from 09:15 to 11:15
        *   Schedule Task 3 from 11:30 to 14:30
        *   Schedule Task 4 from 14:45 to 18:45
    *   **Thursday, June 13, 2025:**
        *   Schedule Task 1 from 08:00 to 09:00.
        *   Schedule Task 2 from 09:15 to 11:15
        *   Schedule Task 3 from 11:30 to 14:30
        *   Schedule Task 4 from 14:45 to 18:45
    *   **Friday, June 14, 2025:**
        *   Schedule Task 1 from 08:00 to 09:00.
        *   Schedule Task 2 from 09:15 to 11:15
        *   Schedule Task 3 from 11:30 to 14:30
        *   Schedule Task 4 from 14:45 to 18:45
    *   **Saturday, June 15, 2025:**
        *   Schedule Task 1 from 08:00 to 09:00.
        *   Schedule Task 2 from 09:15 to 11:15
        *   Schedule Task 3 from 11:30 to 14:30
        *   Schedule Task 4 from 14:45 to 18:45

4.  **Conflict Resolution:**
    *   The blocked time for the morning meeting on Monday was considered, and tasks were scheduled around it.

5.  **Limitations:**
    *   The schedule assumes tasks can be split across days, if needed. Given that is not explicit, the entire task is scheduled in a single day if possible.
    *   The provided heuristics are basic. More complex heuristics (e.g., task dependencies, deadlines, energy levels) could improve the schedule.
    *   No breaks or meals are specifically scheduled.

6.  **Potential Improvements:**
    *   Incorporate user-defined breaks and meals into the schedule.
    *   Implement a more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanism that considers task priority and urgency.
    *   Add a feature to allow users to specify task dependencies.
